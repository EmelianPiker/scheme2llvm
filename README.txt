Makefile makes use of the following programs:
  gsi
    Gambit Scheme interpreter
  llvm-upgrade 
    found in LLVM 2.{0,1,2}
  gcc
  gawk

Issue: Compiler uses too much memory
  "make issue/test-too-much-memory.1.ll" fails 
  "/usr/bin/time -v make test/test-closure.1.ll" shows maximum resident set as
  1108628kb
  Solution: switch from malloc bytecode to libgc's GC_malloc

Issue: libgc does not support tagged pointer, need to change representation to
  regular pointers if we want to use libgc.
  Solution: Change to regular pointers.

Issue: libgc still fails as libgc is scanning 64bit points but we cast
pointers to 32bits.
  Solution: Change representation from uint to ulong. Works!

Issue: LLVM IR generated by bootstrapped compiler is not exactly the same as
interpreted compiler as bootstrap read-string does not interpret \n correctly
  Solution: read-string now converts \n and \t to newline and tab respectively

Output of compiled compiler and Gambit Scheme interpreted compiler
are now identical.
